**Aaron Hardin**

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [lab](http://pharm.ucsf.edu/ahituv/people) of [Nadav Ahituv](http://pharm.ucsf.edu/ahituv) at [UC San Francisco](http://ucsf.edu) working on questions about the impact of genetic variation on gene regulation.  I started my undergraduate studies as a CS major, got hooked on biology, switched my major to molecular biology and now spend the bulk of my time writing code anyway.  This blog is an outlet for science writing and raising public awareness of both cutting edge and basic knowledge.  I have a general page here: [aaronhardin.com](http://aaronhardin.com) and you can feel free to contact me by running this python code ''.join(['.edu','@ucsf','aaron.hardin'][::-1])
