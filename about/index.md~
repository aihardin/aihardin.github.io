Text from about/index.md I am a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Nadav Ahituv at UC San Francisco working on questions about the impact of genetic variation on gene regulation.  I started my undergraduate studies as a CS major, got hooked on biology, switched my major to molecular biology and now spend the bulk of my time writing code anyway.  This blog is an outlet for science writing and raising public awareness of both cutting edge and basic knowledge.  I have a general page here aaronhardin.com with more information.
